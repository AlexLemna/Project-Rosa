# ROSEVOMIT/core/logic/

The `core/logic/` directory (folder) holds the primary file for managing Rosevomit's [business logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic), [`LogicController.py`](https://github.com/AlexLemna/rosevomit/blob/master/core/Logic/LogicController.py). It also holds the modules (files) that actually *contain* the business logic.
