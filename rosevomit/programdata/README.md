# ROSEVOMIT/core/data/

The `core/data/` directory (folder) holds the data files that Rosevomit pulls from when it randomly generates names. At the time of writing this README (early May 2019), the data is from the US Census and is mostly stored in plain text files. 

The files in this directory have been modified slightly. The original files were in all-caps and had data on the frequency distribution of the names. Those original files, as well as a file on methodology, can be found in the [`core/data/1990 US Census`](https://github.com/AlexLemna/rosevomit/tree/master/core/Data/1990%20US%20Census) directory or [here](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/1990_census/1990_census_namefiles.html) at census.gov.
