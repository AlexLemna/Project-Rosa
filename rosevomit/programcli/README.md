# ROSEVOMIT/core/cli/

The `core/cli/` directory (folder) contains the modules (files) necessary for Rosevomit's command-line interface. They are generally called by the main script, [`rosevomit.py`](https://github.com/AlexLemna/rosevomit/blob/master/core/rosevomit.py), which is in the [`core/`](https://github.com/AlexLemna/rosevomit/tree/master/core) directory.
