# ROSEVOMIT/rosevomit/projectcli/

The `rosevomit/projectcli/` directory (folder) contains the modules (files) necessary for Rosevomit's command-line interface. They are generally called by the main script, [`rosevomit.py`](https://github.com/AlexLemna/rosevomit/blob/master/rosevomit/rosevomit.py), which is in the [`rosevomit/`](https://github.com/AlexLemna/rosevomit/tree/master/rosevomit) directory.
